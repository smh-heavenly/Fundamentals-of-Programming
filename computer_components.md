# Introduction to the Main Components of a Computer

## 1. Introduction
A computer is an electronic device that processes data to perform various tasks. It consists of multiple components that work together to execute operations efficiently. These components can be broadly categorized into **hardware** and **software**. This document explores the primary hardware components of a computer and their functions.

## 2. Main Hardware Components of a Computer
### 2.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer.
- Executes instructions from programs using its **control unit (CU)** and **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)**.
- Measured in **clock speed (GHz)** and influenced by core count and architecture.
- Examples: Intel Core i9, AMD Ryzen 9.

### 2.2 Memory (RAM & ROM)
#### **Random Access Memory (RAM)**
- Temporary, volatile storage that holds data currently in use.
- Directly affects system performance and multitasking capability.
- Types: DDR4, DDR5.

#### **Read-Only Memory (ROM)**
- Non-volatile memory storing firmware and essential boot instructions.
- Example: BIOS/UEFI firmware.

### 2.3 Storage Devices
#### **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
- Uses spinning magnetic platters to store data.
- Provides large storage capacities at lower costs.
- Example: 2TB Seagate Barracuda HDD.

#### **Solid State Drive (SSD)**
- Uses NAND flash memory for faster read/write speeds.
- Improves system boot times and application load speeds.
- Example: 1TB Samsung NVMe SSD.

### 2.4 Motherboard
- Main circuit board connecting all components.
- Houses CPU socket, RAM slots, storage interfaces, and expansion slots.
- Determines system compatibility and upgrade options.

### 2.5 Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- Converts AC power into regulated DC power for the computerâ€™s components.
- Rated in **watts (W)**; efficiency measured by **80 Plus certification**.
- Example: 750W Corsair PSU.

### 2.6 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Handles rendering of images, videos, and graphics-intensive tasks.
- **Integrated GPU**: Built into the CPU (e.g., Intel Iris Xe).
- **Dedicated GPU**: Separate card for high-performance computing (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090).

### 2.7 Input Devices
- Allow users to interact with the computer.
- Examples: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner.

### 2.8 Output Devices
- Display processed data to the user.
- Examples: Monitor, printer, speakers.
